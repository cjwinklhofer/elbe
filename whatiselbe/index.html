				<p>This article describes why the ELBE project was born.</p>

<h1 id="early-embedded-linux-devices">early embedded Linux devices</h1>
<p>Well, first we should look at embedded devices to see what they used to look
like and how some of them look like today.</p>

<p>The first devices, that were initially called embedded Linux, had about 4MiB
flash and around 16MiB of RAM. With these constrains in mind people started to
hack a root file system for their devices. If they had bad luck you had to
start with building a cross toolchain first.</p>

<p>Once that part was over you could focus on the user land. Busybox is a good
tool to start with since it contains most of the required programs in a small
single binary. Those programs and a few configurations files on top and you
were done. Maybe you had to compile your “added value” binary or something
else that was not part of busybox but that was it.</p>

<h1 id="cross-build-toolkits">Cross-build Toolkits</h1>
<p>Now sum up the single steps which were required to create a root file from
scratch and create a tool to ease your life. This is when tools like
OpenEmbedded, EDLK were born. Those tools are still good as long as they are
well maintained. They aren’t just projects that are that small these days.
A lot of them are getting very complex. This includes hardware that has much
more RAM and a GiBs of NAND flash if not replaced by a disk or mmc card and
the software, that is used, is more extensive.</p>

<h1 id="rootfilesystems-are-getting-bigger-and-bigger">Rootfilesystems are getting bigger and bigger</h1>
<p>A lot of libraries are used to ease the development of a system.
A toolkit for GUI development, several libraries for multimedia support just
to name a few.</p>

<p>Depending on the build environment that is used, it is more or less difficult
to add a package that is not yet included. It depends on the scripting
language that is used, the format keeping the build instructions and the
user’s ability to understand it and make changes.</p>

<h1 id="adding-debuging-tools-is-not-that-easy">Adding Debuging Tools is not that easy</h1>
<p>Adding a debug version of a package to the root file system means a rebuild or
restart of the build process to create this piece of the rootfile system
assuming that a debug version can be selected (and not added to the build
process). Even then the debug version isn’t installed in a jiffy.</p>

<p>There is usually one person in charge of the root file system and a few others
that are developing the application or a component of the application. One of
the application developers has a problem and wants just to install a debug
version of the library in question or replace it with a later version of it or
a substitute library just to see if his problem goes away or not.
He doesn’t necessarily know how to handle the build environment to make such
changes. So he has to ask the person in charge of the root filesystem to make
this change and send him the new filesystem.</p>

<p>The application developer never did this kind of work because the Linux
distribution on his desktop computer takes care of these things for him.
The same distribution runs a test suite (if available) of the package after it
has been built to spot problems in the compiled binaries which can’t be run if
the package is cross compiled.</p>

<h1 id="no-bugtracking-informations-available">No Bugtracking Informations available</h1>
<p>Another missing feature is the bug tracking against all packages in the root
file system including security updates. This can be a full time job for one
person even just by looking after 10 packages with a reasonable size. So why
try to do a lot of work alone while this work is already done by large
communities around Linux distribution like Debian?</p>

<h1 id="debian-for-embedded">Debian for embedded?</h1>
<p>Instead of doing the work again we tried to figure out how Debian could be
reused in a way that will fulfill our needs.</p>
