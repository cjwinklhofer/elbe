SYNOPSIS
========

   ::

      'elbe preprocess [options] <xmlfile>

.. __description:

DESCRIPTION
===========

Typically elbe preprocess is used to generate an elbe XML file from a
XML file that uses Xincludes, or other XML features. It can be also used
for variant management with the *variant=* attribute.

If e.g. a variant="audio,video" attribute is added to any XML tag, the
tag will only be used if *elbe preprocess* is called with
--variant=audio or --variant=video or --variant=audio,video. If no
--variant is given, the tag will be dropped.

.. __options:

--variant <variant>
